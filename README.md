# Laravel 8 Starter Package featuring GraphQL, Cloudinary API, and ESLint pre-installed

## Who is this for?
This repository serves as a complete starting point for anyone attempting to use Laravel along with GraphQL in order to support static website libraries, such as [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.com). In such a use case where this backend would only serve as your API, the entire `resources/js` folder can be ignored, and for such use cases, I haven't modified it too much.

If you're considering using it as the only _source of truth_ for your entire project, then you might also find it useful.

## Contents

This project consists of the following packages I additionaly set-up:
- [GraphQL](https://lighthouse-php.com/) (with MySQL, a complete switch to [MongoDB](https://github.com/jenssegers/laravel-mongodb) is being discussed in my head)
- ESLint ([huge thanks to Wesbos for his template](https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos))
- [Cloudinary API](https://github.com/cloudinary-labs/cloudinary-laravel)

### Post-Installation Set-up, AKA How to make above mentioned packages work
* `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=lighthouse-schema`
* `npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-wesbos`
* `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="CloudinaryLabs\CloudinaryLaravel\CloudinaryServiceProvider" --tag="cloudinary-laravel-migration"`
* `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="CloudinaryLabs\CloudinaryLaravel\CloudinaryServiceProvider" --tag="cloudinary-laravel-config"`

Or follow the guides for each package, I might have pasted unnecessary lines ðŸ˜Š

If you're going to use Cloudinary API, don't forget to set the `CLOUDINARY_URL` key in your `.env` file.

Note that the `graphql/schema.graphql` file is empty. Please create any models you might want to use in your project by yourself and define the necessary Types, Fields, or Directives.
